# SpyGlass Linting Report: `full_adder` Module

## What is SpyGlass?

SpyGlass is a comprehensive static linting and RTL analysis tool widely used in the semiconductor industry to ensure RTL (Verilog/VHDL) code quality, correctness, and readiness for synthesis and simulation. Developed by Synopsys, it enables early-stage design verification by identifying a range of issues before simulation, such as:

- Coding guideline violations  
- Synthesis incompatibilities  
- Simulation mismatches  
- Clock domain crossing (CDC) issues  
- Redundant logic  
- Design for test (DFT) problems  
- Best-practice and maintainability warnings  

SpyGlass helps reduce design iterations, improve code robustness, and accelerate time-to-tapeout by catching critical issues early in the RTL stage.

## Objective of this SpyGlass Linting Run

The primary objective of this SpyGlass linting run was to perform static RTL analysis on the `full_adder` module to identify:

- Coding guideline violations  
- Simulation mismatches  
- Synthesis issues  
- Best-practice warnings  

The goal was to ensure the RTL is clean, synthesis-ready, and functionally robust, with a particular focus on:

- Detecting unintended latch inference and combinational logic errors  
- Ensuring clock domain consistency and proper signal synchronization  
- Identifying redundant or unused logic  
- Maintaining Verilog coding standards to improve design readability and maintainability  

## File Analyzed

- `full_adder.v`

## Next Steps

- Refactor RTL to address all high-severity and medium-severity linting violations  
- Re-run SpyGlass with clean pass criteria  
- Proceed with functional simulation and synthesis
